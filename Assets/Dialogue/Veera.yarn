    Veera: *sniff*
    Player: Hi there, what's the matter?
    Veera: I've lost Rupert.
    Player: Is Rupert your friend?
    Veera: Yes. Well, sort of.
    Veera: They are my stuffed animal.
    Veera: They are very important to me.
    Veera: I don't know what to do without them.
    Veera: *sob*
    Player: Hey now, it'll be alright.
    Veera: Only if I find Rupert again.
    Veera: Would you keep an eye out for them?
    Veera: And bring them back to me?
    Veera: They are a brown rabbit, with long ears.
    Veera: And they are very soft and fluffy.

    Player: Of course.
    Player: Don't you worry.
    Player: You'll have them back in no time!
    Veera: Thank you. *sniff*
