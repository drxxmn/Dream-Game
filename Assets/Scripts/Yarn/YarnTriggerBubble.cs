// This file is a demonstration of how to build a simple Dialogue View that
// presents lines, by subclassing DialogueViewBase and overriding certain
// important methods.

// Before using this class, you should first get familiar with using the
// built-in Line View and Options List View, which come built-in to Yarn
// Spinner. 

// This file also includes a class called 'Tween', which handles some animation
// work. While it's not actually making any use of Yarn Spinner APIs, it might
// be of interest.

// Import the Yarn.Unity namespace so we get access to Yarn classes.
